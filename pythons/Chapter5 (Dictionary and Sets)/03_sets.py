# Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
# Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Tuple, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
# A set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.
# * Note: Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new items.
# Sets are written with curly brackets.

# Note: Sets are unordered, so you cannot be sure in which order the items will appear.

thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
print(thisset)



set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 6, 7, 7, 7, 9, 9, 9, 8, 8, 0}
print(set)










#empty set 
#emptySet = set()  # we can't use emptySet = {} like this because this for empty dictonary
